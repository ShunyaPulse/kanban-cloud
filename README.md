## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Analytics Panel**:
  - Average Lead Time (duration from creation to completion).
  - Throughput (14-day completion velocity bar chart).
  - Active WIP limit warnings and column distribution.
- **Interactive Cards**: Subtask checklists with progress tracking, priority badges (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`), rich markdown descriptions, and timestamps.
- **Export & Import**: Full board backup and restore in JSON with strict Zod schema validation.
